Hey!

My passion for learning and supporting others is ever-growing and strengthens with every valuable opportunity that I experience. Similarly, I continuously reflect on my successes, failures, strengths, and weaknesses, further improving my ability to learn and adapt.

I'm always looking for new and fun ways to innovate, automate and analyse.

My primary interests are:
* Statistics (Data analysis, extraction and visualisation)
* Network Management and Development
* Self-Hosting
